# FootballDomain
This is my first full-stack project. I chose to make a website that can display players's stats of the season. You can get information about the players and the teams that I put. You can see what players a team has and you can also go the other way around and see which team a player is playing in.
# Features:
- User can view players from many teams (2 teams for the moment)
- User can view the stats of a specific players
- User can Add new player to a team
- User can Edit a player and make his change team
- User can edit player's stats

# Getting Started with Create React App
This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

# npm start
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

# npm test
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

# npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about deployment for more information.
